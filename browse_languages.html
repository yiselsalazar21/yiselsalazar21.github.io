However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called B, was the language on which the C programming language was based. BCPL introduced several features of many modern programming languages, including using curly braces to delimit code blocks.[3] BCPL was first implemented by Martin Richards of the University of Cambridge in 1967.</p>
