## An online archive for technical languages

Navigation Bar-----

### Home Page
	Your online programming language archive
	With a navigation bar where you can redirect to any page
	An about the author when you scroll

	Home page is not meant to actual display any information, but moreso just a welcoming screen. The point of this is to make the site easy to navigate where the navigation tabs are pretty straight forward and easy to understand

	The home page should have a description, but not too much where it looks overwhelming for one screen. This is why I am adding an "About the Archive" tab. If further information is wanted for the archive, it can be found there.

### Most Popular 
	Exact logistics in progress --->  
	Initial thought process: 	
		This page will have the top 10-15 programming languages
		If theres a way I can allow the user to choose how many top languages they want to see, I'll try to do that. 
		There isn't an exact way to measure a popularity for a language, different git repositiory hosting services record the language that is being used, but that isnt a good way to measure populatity since different software developers use different language. After learning that, I decided that using google trends may be a good way to measure popularity. 

	Based on what data I'm able to get through google trends, whether I'd just get the graphs that they provide or if theres a way to retrieve the data, I would display the trends together of the graphs that are chosen. 

	Aside from the trends displayed, each programming language listed will have its own line graph showing the individual popularity trend and each item should look like this:

	Trend graph:
				Name of Language
				Year of Make
				Small description 
					(What type of language is it, and is it developed from an older language? Why is it so popular?)


### Browse Programming Languages
	Sort By: Creation date, Alphabetically

	Each Item: 
				Picture of Author
									Name of Language
									Year of Make
									Subcategories

### Resources for Learning
	Some kind of searching feature (Search Bar)
	The point of this page is to search for a language after seeing it in the browsing on the other tab. 

	Each language will have a list of resources per language

	This is the chosen feature because there is so many languages that people have never even thought of. Being able to quickly search for resources all in one page would be a great feature. It would ease the searching process for software developers much easier as the resources would be hand picked and ready to use. 


### About the Archive
	Why I chose this topic: 
		For starters, I never realized the million programming languages that existed. When going through an existing list, I realized that I havent heard of 90% of existing programming languages, if not more. 
		As I'm completing a software engineering internship, Ive learned that we constantly have to use languages we have never used before. We're expecting to know and master them based on previous knowledge from our common programming languages such as Python, Java, etc. 
		The goal of this website is to make learning different syntaxes more accessible for users, but also to never lose a language. So many languages are created but then never actually become known and used. This website would change that. Not only can you learn all the different languages that exist, but you will learn more about the history behind the languages and how much they really intertwine.
