        <h2>Most Popular</h2>
        <p class="font_weight-normal">This page displays some of the most popular technical languages all together.
            The graph displayed shows the patterns among them for the past five years. I chose this visualization because
        its interesting how the popularity of certain languages change over time. As we can see, Python is the most popular language.
        This happens to be the language that most people first learn as it uses a lot of general purpose skills and most common coding techniques.
        An interesting pattern I saw was the popularity decrease during December, why do you think that is?</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Browse Programming Languages</h2>
        <p class="font_weight-normal">Do you know how many technical languages exist? I know I dont... I dont think anyone does. An official database with
        every language ever made doesn't really exist. Some are made and never published, some are made and kept internal, and some are made, used once, and never seen again.
        On this tab you can learn about different languages that exist, along with the publisher, year of release, and a little about them. Along with this information, each language
        has a popularity trend showing patterns from the past year. With this features, we can skim through the different languages, gaining the insights regarding what most prominant.
        The best part is that these are contantly updating graphs made with Google Trends, so the patterns are always up to date.</p>

        <h2>Learn a Language</h2>
        <p class="font_weight-normal"> What's even better than learning about a new language? Actually learning it. This archive isn't only to teach you that there are so many languages that
            we never hear of, but also to provide you the resources to actually learn them. This page provides you with information that will help you gain proficiency in any one of the languages
            listed in the tab above. Everything you need is there, give it a try!</p>
